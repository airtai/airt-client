    "\n",
    "    The **User** class has two types of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Methods for creating and managing users.\n",
    "    * Method for updating and adding additional security to user accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Methods such as `create`, `enable`, `disable`, and `ls` can be used to manage user accounts on the server, but access to them requires super user privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The remaining methods do not require super user privileges and are used to update/additionally secure user accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition to the regular authentication with credentials, the users can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) for their accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To help protect your account, we recommend that you enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA provides additional security by requiring you to provide unique verification code (OTP) in addition to your regular sign-in credentials when performing critical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your account can be configured for MFA in just two easy steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To begin, you need to enable MFA for your account by calling the `enable_mfa` method, which will generate a QR code. You can then scan the QR code with an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator and follow the on-device instructions to finish the setup in your smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Finally, activate MFA for your account by calling `activate_mfa` and passing the dynamically generated six-digit verification code from your smartphone's authenticator app.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Single sign-on (SSO) can be enabled for your account in three simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Enable the SSO for a provider by calling the `enable_sso` method with the SSO provider name and an email address. At the moment, we only support \"google\" and \"github\" as SSO providers. We intend to support additional SSO providers in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Before you can start generating new tokens with SSO, you must first authenticate with the SSO provider. Call the get_token with the same SSO provider you have enabled in the step above to generate an SSO authorization URL. Please copy and paste it into your preferred browser and complete the authentication process with the SSO provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After successfully authenticating with the SSO provider, call the `Client.set_sso_token` method to generate a new token and use it automatically in all future interactions with the airt server.\n",
